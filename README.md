# HR Analytics – Predict Employee Attrition

This project focuses on analyzing HR data to uncover key insights about employee attrition and building a predictive model to identify potential churn. The goal is to support HR decision-making through data-driven insights and interactive dashboards.

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaned and transformed dataset (`hr_clean_for_bi.csv`)
   - Handled missing values & duplicates
   - Feature engineering (Age Groups, Salary Bands, etc.)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized attrition trends by age, department, gender, salary, and job role
   - Identified high-risk groups for attrition

3. **Power BI Dashboard**
   - KPIs: Attrition Rate, Active Employees, Average Salary, Average Age
   - Filters: Department, JobRole, Gender, Age Group, Salary Band
   - Interactive slicers for dynamic exploration

4. **Predictive Modeling (Future Scope)**
   - ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
   - Predict employee attrition likelihood

## 📊 KPIs in Power BI
- **Attrition Rate %**
- **Total Employees**
- **Average Age**
- **Average Salary**
- **Attrition Count by Department, JobRole, Age Group, Gender**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Data Cleaning & EDA**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Dashboarding**: Power BI
- **Dataset**: HR dataset (`hr_clean_for_bi.csv`)
